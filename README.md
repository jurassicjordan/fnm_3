# fnm_3
full icon set mimetypes originally made by m4qu3l4n

this icon set is for plasma and similar desktop environments.
It is a 3D style icon set that brings you back to the early 2000s
I noticed there are not alot of these kind of non flat icons around, the exception being fnm and fnm_2
the source repo is not available at this time however I will include their pling repos

this rendition of flat no more focuses on the application icons instead of mimetypes.
